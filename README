Requires at least: 3.1
Tested up to: 3.1.1

This is basically a plugin to purge data from the EdgeCast CDN when you make / change a post or add comments.

== Description ==

If you have your EdgeCast CDN configured in a way that it is caching all of your posts, this will identify all pages necessary and purge them when a post is changed / created. This ensures that, even if the cache hasn't expired, your visitors will see the most up-to-date content.

== Installation ==

Download and upload the WP_EdgeCast folder to the wp-content/plugins/ directory.

Activate it from the Admin panel, and then view the EdgeCast Options and fill in the fields.

All are required and described below:

	* Account Number: this is located in the top left when viewing the EdgeCast control panel.
	* API Token: this is used to authenticate you and without it, you will not be able to purge content successfully.
	* EdgeCast URL:
		- this is either the wac.3F21.edgecastcdn.net/3FF00 type URL 
		  or a CNAME you have created that points to the root of your site.
	* Object Type: you must specify whether it is a Large or Small HTTP Object. These are the only supported types presently.
	* Enable the Plugin: if this box is not checked, it will not do anything. 

In regards to PHP libraries, you will need the following functions available:
	* curl
	* json_encode
